# Feather

An x86 (IA-32) user-level threads implementation. Cooperative. FCFS strategy. Thread-safe.

**This repository is archived. This is an old toy project of mine, which I did back then as a voluntary exercise to some university course.**

The user-level threads act cooperatively, i.e. every thread must voluntarily give up its runtime by either
calling ft\_yield, ft\_exit or returning from its entry point (equivalent to calling ft\_exit).
The scheduler, as implemented in ft\_yield, will select the next (as in the one with the incremented index)
thread which has not yet exited.
If all threads have exited, ft\_run writes their exit codes into the given parameter (if not NULL) and returns.

This implementation only shares state by means of the feather* pointers passed across various functions and
the usage of malloc/free. Assuming malloc/free are thread-safe, you can safely run user-level threads from
_different_ initialized feather\* structures from multiple real threads. Note that user-level threads across real
threads can also share state and communicate among themselves.

## Compatibility Notes:

 1. Currently the only supported compiler is GCC:
    It would most likely work on other compilers with minor modifications,
    e.g. \_\_attribute\_\_ ((â€¦)) directives would need to be ported.
 2. Only works on x86 (IA-32, 32-bit)
 3. The user-level threads must not make use of SSE instructions or SSE registers as these are
    not taken into account when context-switching.

## Trivia

Its name originates from the German word 'Feder' which is sometimes used to refer to user-level-threads
("federgewichtige Threads").
