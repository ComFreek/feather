/**
  * # Feather
  * An x86 (IA-32) user-level threads implementation. Cooperative. FCFS strategy. Thread-safe.
  *
  * The user-level threads act cooperatively, i.e. every thread must voluntarily give up its runtime by either
  * calling ft\_yield, ft\_exit or returning from its entry point (equivalent to calling ft\_exit).
  * The scheduler, as implemented in ft_yield, will select the next (as in the one with the incremented index)
  * thread which has not yet exited.
  * If all threads have exited, ft_run writes their exit codes into the given parameter (if not NULL) and returns.
  *
  * This implementation only shares state by means of the feather* pointers passed across various functions and
  * the usage of malloc/free. Assuming malloc/free are thread-safe, you can safely run user-level threads from
  * _different_ initialized feather\* structures from multiple real threads. Note that user-level threads across real
  * threads can also share state and communicate among themselves.
  *
  * ## Compatibility Notes
  *
  *  1. Currently the only supported compiler is GCC:
  *     It would most likely work on other compilers with minor modifications,
  *     e.g. \_\_attribute\_\_ ((â€¦)) directives would need to be ported.
  *  2. Only works on x86 (IA-32, 32-bit)
  *  3. The user-level threads must not make use of SSE instructions or SSE registers as these are
  *     not taken into account when context-switching.
  *
  * ## Trivia
  * Its name originates from the German word 'Feder' which is sometimes used to refer to user-level-threads
  * ("federgewichtige Threads").
